# Intelligent Skin Disease Detection and Classification System

This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects and classifies various skin diseases using image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is built using Python, Django, TensorFlow, and a pre-trained VGG16 model. It aims to assist dermatologists and users in early identification of skin conditions through image analysis.
